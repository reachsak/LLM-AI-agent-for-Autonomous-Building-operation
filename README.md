# Project Description

This project introduces an advanced AI agent designed to oversee autonomous building operation and facilities management. The proposed LLM-based autonomous building operation framework combines IoT devices, smart building facilities, LLMs, and blockchain technologies to create a decentralized and automated system for managing building systems.

## Threshold-Based Automation System

The threshold-based automation system utilizes the AI agent to continuously monitor real-time sensor data and compare it with these predefined thresholds. If the environmental conditions exceed these thresholds, the AI agent uses its function-calling capabilities to take action, such as adjusting HVAC setpoints, modifying lighting intensity, or triggering alerts to maintain optimal building conditions.These threshold values are the baseline comfort parameters for ensuring optimal comfort and indoor environmental quality

## Occupancy-Based Automation System

The proposed AI agent will adjust the performance of building systems (e.g., HVAC performance or lighting intensity) based on occupancy level to dynamically optimize energy consumption.For example, during low occupancy periods, the AI agent may reduce HVAC intensity or dim the lighting to conserve energy. Conversely, during high occupancy, the agent ensures that environmental conditions are optimal for occupants. The system also accommodates user preferences and feedback through natural language processing, enabling users to provide specific requests or adjust system behaviors dynamically.

## Key Features
- **Integration with IoT and Sensors:** Collects real-time environmental data such as temperature, humidity, and energy usage, as well as occupancy information, using IoT devices and sensors.
- **Threshold-Based Control:** Automates building operations by comparing sensor data against predefined thresholds and triggering actions to maintain comfort and efficiency.
- **Occupancy-Based Decision-Making:** Dynamically adjusts building systems based on occupancy data to optimize energy consumption and environmental quality.

## Benefits
The LLM-based AI agent provides an unprecedented level of flexibility and adaptability, surpassing traditional automation systems. By integrating threshold-based automation and contextual decision-making, this system enhances building efficiency, reduces energy consumption, and delivers a responsive and user-centric approach to smart building management.
